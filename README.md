ToppFun → aPEAR Pipeline
Automated pathway clustering & visualization for ToppFun enrichment results

This repository provides a complete R workflow for processing ToppFun enrichment analysis results and generating aPEAR pathway similarity networks. The pipeline takes raw ToppFun output, cleans and restructures the table, identifies overlapping pathways, performs clustering, and produces publication-ready network plots.

Features

- ✔ Fully automated pipeline from ToppFun file → final network plots
- ✔ Removes unwanted enrichment categories
- ✔ Deduplicates pathways by p-value
- ✔ Runs aPEAR clustering with user-defined parameters
- ✔ Supports both p-value-based coloring and single-color networks
- ✔ Saves results into an organized output directory
